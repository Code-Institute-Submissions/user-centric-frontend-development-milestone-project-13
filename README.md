# Milestone Project 1 - User Centric Frontend Development

## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to create a static website using the skills and techniques 
we've learned in HTML and CSS. I decided to design and create a website for a Hypnotherapy business,
as it's a discipline I'm currently practising in, and so I felt I had enough knowledge to structure a user's 
journey appropriately. 

The area of hypnotherapy I chose to focus on was providing hypnotherapy solutions and support primarily for
learners and creators (writers, muscians, etc). The unusual area would also challenge me to create, not just a visually
user-freindly design, but also in terms of quality content.

## UX 
### User Background
My approach to the UX design was to first establish the feelings I wanted to invoke in the user. 
To do this, I had to consider who the user likely was. In this case, it could be someone of any background, 
but who is looking for support and guidance to achieve a personal goal (eg to learn a new language or create something).
This person is likely stressed, frustrated and possibly anxious. So the feelings I wanted to envoke were those of
comfort and trust.

I also considered the user's expectations before they entered the website. For some, Hypnotherapy might be associated
with spiritual approaches rather than phsychological, which may turn potential clients off. To avoid triggering a
reflex skeptical response from a user, I decided to choose "grounded" and earthly colours, instead of sky-associated 
palettes of blues and pinks (commonly used in spiritual-related media) as well as floral images.

With these elements in mind, I concluded the most advantagous theme for this business would be a mixture of warmth, tradition,
logic and a feeling of prestiege. By combining these, the user would be more likely to engage with the website and 
increase conversion rate.

### Market Research
I conducted some market research by searching for websites of the brands most associated with trust and prestiege and knowledge.
I visited the websites and took note of the structures, colors and content, to better understand what a user expects 
in those contexts. World reknowned universities, government websites, luxury hotels, cars, jewelry and prestiegous
media companies, all designed to encourage trust in their brands were included in the samples.

I noticed the frequent use of dark blue and white (or off-white) and with older brands, the importance of a strong, 
elegant and clean logo. 

### Logo
I had a logo design that conceptually would be suitable. So with the help of a graphic designer (Eoin Brennan), I 
had a digital version made, with the instruction for it to be made square, more elegant, with a better negative space ratio.
The logo is of two N's, the second one overlapping the first. As this website is about learning and becoming a more 
improved version of yourself, the image of the second letter overlapping the previous, seemed fitting. 
The N is from my surname, as this website was for own potential hypnotherapy business. This logo will feature on the 
top left hand corner of each of the webpages as part of the navbar.

### Colour Palette
As mentioned previously, a deep blue was very frequently used in the samples I researched. I chose a dark green as
the most distinguished colour as it would have a similar sense of depth, but with the added benefits of being more
unique. The colour reminded me of forest vegitation, which allows me to incorporate the calming influence of 
nature, without veering into the more spiritual assocations. This green is also reminiscent of leather chairs and
leather topped desks which used to sit in studies and offices - again reminding the user of knowledge.

Accompanying the green would be cream and yellow and light browns, to resemble parchment, leather, wood and brass.

### Font 
A cursive font called "Tangerine" was selected to be the main title fonts (for all except the jumbotron). The font
style was legible while resembling the writing of a fountain pen.

Roboto was chosen for the text of the main body for its clear and easy-to-read appearance.
